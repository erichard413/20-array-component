Before Getting Started
There is no starting code for this project. This project is used purely as a way to test your knowledge of working with arrays and state. Each of the functions that I ask you to create should have a button rendered in the JSX that executes that function and the JSX should also render the array as a comma separated string.

You can do this with either class components or function components (I recommend function components), but there is no need to do both as they are very similar.

Functionality To Create
Create state that stores an array with the initial value of ["A", "B", "C"]
Add the ability to remove the first element from the array
Add the ability to remove a specific letter from the array
Add the ability to add a new element to the start of the array
Add the ability to add a new element to the end of the array
Add the ability to clear the array
Add the ability to reset the array to the initial value
Bonus Functionality
These are optional challenges that are more difficult and will really test your skills.

Add the ability to update all A elements in the array to H
Add an input that is connected to state and a button that will add the input value to the start of the array
Add the ability to add a new element at any index in the array
